# Power BI Projects

ðŸ“Š Dashboards and reports created using Power BI.

These projects demonstrate my ability to connect Excel and SQL data sources, build financial visualisations, and use DAX for dynamic calculations.

## Highlights:
- Accounts Receivable dashboard with aging buckets and overdue flags
- Dynamic customer filtering and drill-down analysis
- KPI scorecards and trend visualisations

ðŸ›  Tools used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Excel
